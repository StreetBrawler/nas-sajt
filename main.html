            Planned as the first chapter of a trilogy from the very beginning, Mass Effect was developed over the course of three and a half years and uses the Unreal Engine 3 as a groundwork. 
			It was designed so that the player would assume the role of a central character that could make important decisions and impact the story of the game in numerous ways. 
			The combat was designed to offer the tactics and customization of a role-playing game, but through a simpler and real-time third-person shooter interface. In 2008 and 2009, 
			two downloadable content packs that introduced new missions to the base game were released.
		</p>
		
		<p style="text-indent: 30px;">
            Mass Effect received critical acclaim from video game publications and sold more than one and a half million copies by January 2008. 
			Critics praised the game's interactive storytelling and cinematic design, but criticized its unbalanced combat mechanics and poor artificial intelligence. 
			The game received several year-end awards, including Best RPG at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards and Roleplaying Game of the Year at the 2008 Interactive Achievement Awards. 
			Mass Effect was ported to the Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3 platforms in 2008 and 2012, respectively. A sequel, Mass Effect 2, was released in 2010.
